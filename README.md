## Getting Started

Within the preparation phase, A lot of my time was spent reviewing and familiarizing myself with store, reducer, and dispatch functions. I mapped out what components needed to be created and how I could pass information between the components. 

### Prerequisites

A database.sql is required for this program to run (please see the database file in the repository). 

## Usage

This app helps you submit feedback about your feelings, understanding of content, support received, as well as any additional comments! 

You can easily mark your evaluations using a minimalistic drop-down menu. Once you have selected a number, you are able to move on to the next evaluation question. Need to change an answer from a previous question? No problem! You can navigate back to a previous page to edit your answers. You can also review all of your inputs before submitting your feedback!
