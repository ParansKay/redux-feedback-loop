Getting Started
Within the preparation phase, A lot of my time was spent reviewing and familiarizing myself with store, reducer, and dispatch functions. I mapped out what components needed to be created and how I could pass information between the components.

Prerequisites
A database.sql is required for this program to run (please see the database file in the repository).

Installation
Usage
This app helps you submit feedback about your feelings, understanding of content, support received, as well as any additional comments!

You can easily mark your evaluations using a minimalistic drop-down menu. Once you have selected a number, you are able to move on to the next evaluation question. Need to change an answer from a previous question? No problem! You can navigate back to a previous page to edit your answers. You can also review all of your inputs before submitting your feedback!
